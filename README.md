# WEATHER NEWS

## Description

Our Weather News is inspired by the need to practice how to use an api and be able to use it on client and server sides. We created this project because we needed a website that provides weather information without competing against all the ads that regular weather websites have. We resolved the extra context from other weather websites by keeping what is essential: the city and its weather for up to five days. We learned that setting the server to communicate with the client can be complex and overwhelming.
